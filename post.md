Clockface Installation Bug
=====

There seems to be a bug in Ionic and Versa series watches that can result in clockface installations failing to complete. Instead, the installation progress bar continues to cycle. It may eventually stop and report an error. Attempts to retry the installation may not succeed.

A quick solution that sometimes works is to use the Clocks app on your watch to select a different clockface, and then reselect the one you want.

If that doesn't work, you'll need to get rid of the errant clockface so a fresh try can be made. Here's how:
* Force-close the Fitbit app, then restart it. Alternatively, shut down and restart your phone and watch, then restart them.
* If the Clocks section of the Fitbit app offers to attempt to continue the installation, select 'later'.
* Instead of attempting to reinstall the clockface you're having trouble with, install a simpler clockface (such as one of those developed by Fitbit).
* Use the Fitbit app to remove the clockface that you couldn't install.
* Try to install that clockface again.
* It's possible that the installation will fail a second time. If so, try again.

If you know of any other possible solutions, please post them here!
