Clockface Installation Bug
=====

There seems to be a problem in Ionic and Versa series watches that can result in clockface installations failing to complete. Instead, the installation progress bar continues to cycle. It may eventually stop and report an error. Attempts to retry the installation may not succeed.

A quick solution that sometimes works is to use the Clocks app on your watch to select a different clockface, and then reselect the one you want.

If that doesn't work, try this longer version:
* Force-close the Fitbit app on your phone, and leave it closed.
* Start the Clocks app on your watch, and switch to the clockface you're trying to install.
* Restart the Fitbit app on your phone, and make sure it syncs with your watch.
* Check the Clock Faces section of the Fitbit app and ensure that the new clockface installs correctly.

If you still can't get it going, you'll need to get rid of the errant clockface so a fresh try can be made. Here's how:
* Force-close the Fitbit app on your phone, then restart it. Alternatively, shut down and restart your phone and watch, then restart them.
* If the Clocks section of the Fitbit app offers to attempt to continue the installation, select 'later'.
* If selecting 'later' doesn't stop the installation, you'll need to try shutting things down again. You can't proceed until the installation progress bar has stopped.
* Instead of attempting to reinstall the clockface you're having trouble with, install a simpler clockface (such as one of those developed by Fitbit).
* Use the Fitbit app to remove the clockface that you couldn't install.
* Try to install that clockface again.
* It's possible that the installation will fail a second time. If so, try again.
